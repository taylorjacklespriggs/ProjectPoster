## Synopsis

This is a Python3/Flask webserver tested with Cucumber in Java. The webserver allows a student to login with a name and student number, then select a project.

## Motivation

This project was developed by Taylor Jackle Spriggs for a software quality assurance assignment at Carleton University.

## Installation

The webserver requires Python3 and Flask to be installed. The webserver can be started as a Python module with `python3 -m project_poster`.

## Testing

The Cucumber testing portion is an Eclipse project. Eclipse will install the dependencies required. Tests can be executed using the TestRunner class. The appropriate chromedriver for your platform must be downloaded from https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.27/ and installed under the CucumberTesting folder.
